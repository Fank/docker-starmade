# starmade-docker

A Docker container for running a dedicated StarMade server.

I've taken some lengths to ensure that the configurations are VOLUME-mountable
and that you can thereby upgrade servers by having a data-container that is
mounted from by the actual server.

I have not tested this thoroughly, so be aware of that fact before relying on
it.
